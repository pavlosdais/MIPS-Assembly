# MIPS Assembly
This is a collection of different types of (simple) programs involving integers, strings & floats all created in [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) assembly as part of the [Computer Architecture I](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en/studies/undergraduate/36) Lab learning process.

* [Floats](https://github.com/pavlosdais/MIPS-Assembly/tree/main/src/Floats)

A short explanation of what each program does is at the very first line, commented out.
